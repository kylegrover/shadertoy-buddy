Rewrite this shader to include comments that help to explain what each portion does.
Avoid writing superfluous comments that just restate what a line of code does.
The comments should explain why the code is there, and what it does in the context of the shader.
Respond with only the shader. No extra commentary or formatting is required, just start and end with the rewritten shader code.
Do not modify the shader in any other way, just add comments.
